# Next Word Prediction System

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a next word prediction system using an N-gram model. Given a sequence of words, the system predicts the next word based on the probabilities calculated from a corpus of text data.

## Features
- Supports prediction for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
- Allows customization of N-gram size.
- Provides an evaluation module for assessing prediction accuracy.
- User-friendly interface for inputting text and viewing predictions.

## Installation

2.	Install dependencies:

## Usage
       1. Prepare your text corpus and ensure it is in a suitable format.
       2. Run the preprocessing script to tokenize and clean the corpus:
## Usage
       3. Train the model by specifying the N-gram size and the cleaned corpus file:
       4. Use the trained model for prediction:

## Evaluation
To evaluate the prediction accuracy, run the evaluation script:
